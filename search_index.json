Including this optional parameter (done in the following example) in step function or execution hook makes runner to wait for the completion of the async operation.\ngauge.step(&quot;Vowels in English language are &lt;vowels&gt;&quot;, function (vowels, done) {\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    done();\n  }, 1000);\n});\n\nHandling assertions and errors in async tests\nIf an asynchronous test code can throw an error, or if you use assertions in an asynchronous test, wrap the assertions in a try-catch block and pass the error to done():\ngauge.step(&quot;I am run async and I may fail&quot;, function (done) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        try {\n            assert.equal(true, false);\n        } catch (e) {\n            done(e);\n        }\n    }, 1000);\n});\n\n"},"syntax/execution-hooks.html":{"url":"syntax/execution-hooks.html","title":"Execution hooks","body":"Execution Hooks\ngauge-js supports tagged execution hooks.

It can contain the following properties:\n\ntags: Default: [].\nAn array of strings for the tags for which to execute the current callback. These are only useful at specification or scenario level. If not specified, the provided callback is executed on each occurrence of the hook.\noperator: Valid values: &quot;AND&quot;, &quot;OR&quot;. Default: &quot;AND&quot;.\nThis controls whether the current callback is executed when all of the tags match (in case of &quot;AND&quot;), or if any of the tags match (in case of OR).\n\nExample of a tagged execution hook implementation:\ngauge.hooks.beforeScenario(function () {\n  assert.equal(vowels[0], &quot;a&quot;);\n}, { tags: [ &quot;single word&quot; ]});\n\nAsync operations in execution hooks\ngauge.hooks.beforeStep(function (context, done) {\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    done();\n  }, 1000);\n});\n\n"},"syntax/custom-messages.html":{"url":"syntax/custom-messages.html","title":"Custom messages","body":"Custom messages\nSyntax: gauge.message(&lt;string&gt;)\nUse the gauge.message(&lt;String&gt;) function to send custom messages to gauge in your step implementations.

Like: DEBUG=true gauge specs/. This needs gauge v0.3.2 or newer.\n\nHow it works\nSetting the debug option will launch the runner code through node-debug. It will start node-inspector, launch Chrome DevTools and pause on the first line of execution. You will need to continue execution to let gauge carry on with its execution.\nYou can set debugger; inside step implementation or hook callbacks to pause execution in the debugger. This retains the gauge context and gives you a full blown debugger to debug your test implementations.\nExample:\ngauge.step(&quot;There are &lt;num&gt; vowels.&quot;, function (num) {\n  debugger;\n  assert.equal(num, 5);\n});\n\nThis will pause the debugger when this step&#39;s callback is executed by gauge-js.\nCaveats\n\nThe debugger exposes entire gauge-js runner code.\nYou need to be quick enough to hit continue in the browser when node-inspector launches. If this takes too long, gauge will timeout connecting to the API. A workaround for this is to increase the runner_connection_timeout property to an acceptable value.\n\n"},"configuration.html":{"url":"configuration.html","title":"Configuration","body":"Configuration\nJavaScript specific configuration changes can be made in the env/default/js.properties file.\n\n\n\nProperty\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntest_timeout\n1000\nSpecify test timeout in milliseconds.
